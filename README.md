# Comp4106Project

Designed to take in a photo and using a genetic algorithm guess the picture based on one of two possible initial populations,

- Picutres with random pixels 

- pictures that have been predetermined to be of the same classification as the picture choosen (for example if the picture was deemed 
as a park then the inital population would be pictures of parks)
